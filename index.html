        <p>This map shows the state and county-level results of the 2020 Presidential Election. 
        This map is modelled after the choropleth style used in this 
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/05/us/elections/results-kentucky-governor-general-election.html" targe="_blank">New York Times piece.</a>
        Both maps were created using mapbox.
    </p>

        <p>This graduated point map is another version of the same election result inspired by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2012/results/president.html" target="_blank">similar map</a>
            created by the New York Times after the 2012 Presidential Election.</p>
